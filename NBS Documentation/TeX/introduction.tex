\section{Introduction}

\subsection{Overview}

The NFM Ballistic System (NBS) is designed for gathering and managing data from laboratory ballistic tests. Historically, test results were recorded manually in Excel spreadsheets and transferred via USB flash drives, posing several challenges such as data inconsistency, lack of centralized access, and potential data loss. Recognizing the need for a more robust solution, a dedicated system was developed for managing ballistic test data.

\subsection{System Components}

The system comprises three main components:
\begin{itemize}
	\item \href{https://orga9b1f99a.crm4.dynamics.com/main.aspx?appid=05ee93e5-63be-e911-a95f-000d3ab5e874&pagetype=entitylist&etn=craab_nbsgrouporder&viewid=2e17b148-b9c6-4803-9c9e-780fa5c0f116&viewType=1039}{Construction Creator App}: An application used by ballistic engineers to design ballistic constructions.
	\item \href{https://apps.powerapps.com/play/e/default-6013a954-a3ca-49c2-b3e2-288264752369/a/e1db19c6-4475-4b66-be3b-fcec7d220129?tenantId=6013a954-a3ca-49c2-b3e2-288264752369}{Test Logging Interface}: A user interface for recording and storing test data directly in the system.

\end{itemize}

\subsection{Challenges}

The NBS system faces several challenges:
\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{Data Inconsistency}: The data stored within the system is disorganized and lacks uniformity, making analysis time-consuming and difficult.
	\item \textbf{Lack of Documentation}: The system lacks updated documentation, with the last version dated 2019. Since then, the system has undergone significant changes.
	\item \textbf{Overall Complexity}: The system's design and architecture are complex and difficult to navigate, which complicates maintenance and further development.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Project Goals}
The primary goals for this project include:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item \textbf{System Exploration}: Thoroughly explore and analyze the NBS system to understand its structure, the tables storing data, the solutions utilized, and the Power BI reports used for analysis.
	\item \textbf{Data Quality Analysis}: Assess the quality and usefulness of the available data.
	\item \textbf{Documentation}: Provide an overview of the current system structure and document the findings.
	\item \textbf{Recommendations}: Propose recommendations for future improvements.
\end{enumerate}
